# BattleShip-Demo
A C++ version of battleship!

Type your coordinates to place your mark on the grid and see if you can sink the enemy's ships. Currently has 5 ship types, Airship(A), Battleship(B), Frigate (F), Sub(S), Destroyer(D).

Also has commented out code, which can be uncommented and shows the enemy's board for testing (or cheating) purposes
